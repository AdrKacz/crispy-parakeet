# Objectives of research

I will understand life and intelligent life. And then, I will create life and intelligent life.

I will complete my first objective when I will have a generic concept that describe life independently of any implementation of this concept.  The implementation of life on earth is organic life and the implementation of intelligent life on earth involves an organic brain. However, the concept shall not be linked to any physical representation, even if successful representation can help to understand the underlying concept.

I will complete my second objective when I will have an interactive interface that gets along with the previously defined concept. This interactive interface will have to look alive for the great majority. This interactive interface will have to be independent in its environment.


# How to define life?

What is life? Life is a concept that every human grasp easily without a need for further explanation. You can immediately state that a bird, a dog or a human is alive. However, the more an organism is small the harder it is to make intuitively the distinction between alive and not alive. Nevertheless, even the movement of tiny cells on a microscope makes you think of life.

Life is a so simple concept that is tricky to properly defining it. According to the Cambridge dictionary, life is "*the period between birth and death, or the experience or state of being alive*". Then if you look for the definition of alive, you will find "*living, not dead*", for living "*alive now*" and for dead "*not now living*". Apart from the fact that these definitions don't help to understand the concept, I disagree with them on two point.

First, the fact that life is finite isn't necessary, it is an observation and consequences of the organic metabolisms that support life.

Second, it is necessary to state that something is alive when it is independent from observation. By independent from observation, I don't mean that the living body cannot be helped by other living bodies of not living substances, indeed a lot of living beings live in symbiosis. By independent from observation, I mean that if the living beings exists when you observe it, the living beings will still exists when you'll stop observing it.

**TODO: Notion of independence to define more accurately**

**TODO: More detailed discussion about what is life**.

**TODO: Are you alive if others -people, animals- think you are alive?**.

# Between life and performance

Most of the time, you create an algorithm to solve an issue. Thus, your algorithm is use in this precise context and paused or shut down when the issue is solved. The issue can be simple as moving as object along a line or complex as weather forecasting.

Why do I want to focus on life first and not on intelligence ? In fact, it mainly depends on your goal. If your goal is to achieve better performance at a given task, you focus on intelligence. However my goal is to understand the concept of life and to create a form of intelligent life.

**TODO: Distinction between machine learning algorithms and intelligence. Why setting a goal prevent you from creating life, if so?**

There is a fundamental distinction between performance and intelligence. What the current state of the art algorithms in Intelligence Artificial achieve is performance. Indeed, these algorithms performs well in a given task. Example of task are image recognition, prediction, or speech.

**TODO: Are you intelligent if you are performant enough?**.

## An aside on GPT-3

I will briefly examine the latest task example: speech. The best example is GPT-3, an amazing algorithm accessible that is able to produce complex answers. Don't get me wrong, the result is awesome, and the algorithm even state that it is intelligent when you ask it. Thus, you have two way of tackling the problem of intelligence with GPT-3.

First, you assume that the algorithm is indeed intelligent. That makes sense, the algorithm is able to process complex question, to extract information, to calculate, to guess result and even to make subtle jokes.

Second, you assume that the algorithm performs extremely well in text prediction. Indeed, GPT-3 was trained on hundreds of billion of text examples, thus most of the text you will provide for prediction will trigger a pattern already seen during training.

This raise an important dilemma, are you intelligent if you are performant enough ? Or, can you mimic intelligence with good performance ? The answer to the first question is quite hard and I don't have a definitive answer, even though I think the answer is no. The answer to the second question is definitely yes. GPT-3 is good example because it performs well at the complicated task. However, you'll find really performant algorithms that performs simple task in video game that mimic intelligent choices. Shoal of fish for example, the intelligence is not comparable to human intelligence but the simulation performs well enough to mimic fish intelligence.

**TODO: Referential of Intelligence. What is intelligent and what is not mainly depends on your referential.**

# The necessity of reproduction

**TODO: How reproduction help to define life?**

# Quantum physics and consciousness

**TODO: Read the paper [Consciousness and the Collapse of the Wave Function](https://philpapers.org/archive/CHACAT-24.pdf)**

*NOTE: I am not inclined toward these concepts, I think they will only lead us to more complex representation. Moreover, I don't think Quantum Physics is the easiest way to describe how the world works (this is for another day).*

# Why do I want to conceptualise and create consciousness?

I want to conceptualise consciousness because I wish to understand who I am and how I work better.

Indeed, I often **[find sources]** hear that consciousness is separated from your body like something you cannot grasp. However, I think this idea is wrong and just try to hide the fact that death ends your conscious experience. Indeed, this idea of separation between the mind and the body claims that your mind will leave your body when you will die. That gives you an eternal life to experiment after you life and create hope. Although there are stories where the mind is trapped in the body, those are only sentence for bad behaviour in life before death **[find sources]**.

On the other hand, if you consider that your mind and your body are one thing, this implies that when you die your mind dies too. Since you cannot resurrect with the current technologies, that is a one way door phenomenon *[one way door things cannot be reversed while two way doors can]*. It is much easier to conceptualise the mind as a consequence of the body rather than as a different object. Indeed, if you consider it has a different object, you have to consider from where it comes? what is its life cycle? and, from where does it power itself to sustain for eternity? These questions, especially the last one are, are difficult to answer.

If you consider your mind to be a part of your body and a sensation of your body, it means that you will probably be able to explain of your mind works, as any other part of your body. However, if you are able to understand of your mind work, you are now able to predict your own conscious before you are aware of it. This prediction may not be a long term prediction, or may not exist at all. Indeed, a model doesn't have to give a precise result and can be based on uncertainty or chaos theory. Nevertheless, the fact that your mind is now just another piece of your body remove all its importance.

You may conclude that you don't exist and that an human body is just the result of million of cells, bacteria and others that interact with each others. These interactions create connection between these living things and your existence can be describe as an ant colony. The ant colony is none of the ant, and it exists only thanks to the cohesion of its parts.

**TODO: Go deeper into how this image can help to conceptualise consciousness and why it is not enough**
