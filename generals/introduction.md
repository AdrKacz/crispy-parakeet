Hi,

I am a french student in engineering school, and I will graduate next year in September 2022.

I am interested in applying for a PhD at your university, and particularly in your laboratory. I want to introduce myself and explain what topic I would like to study.

If my email hooks you, I would love to hear back from you and start a conversation about my research proposal.

If at any point you feel you won't be the best person to help me in my research, please feel free to let me know who you think I should have contacted.

---

I have studied mathematics (statistics, probability, calculus), physics (quantum physics, fluid physics, classical mechanics, optics) and chemistry (organic chemistry, inorganic chemistry, analytical chemistry, physical chemistry) as part of my undergraduate and graduate journey. I have attended more in-depth classes on robotics, machine learning, computer science and neuroscience.

I fell in love with computer science during my childhood. I love to create algorithms and interact with them. As part of my passion, I had personal projects in game development or reinforcement learning and attended additional classes at MITOpenCourseware on Artificial Intelligence.

Naturally, I considered the conception of a conscious algorithm: an algorithm that expresses spontaneous interactivity without any predefined rules. How to create such an algorithm is an elegant problem. Indeed, you will feel what is to be sentient, but you will struggle to theorise it.

During the past years, I spent my free time documenting myself about Artificial Intelligence and Consciousness. Moreover, I came up with a model for a conscious living being, which I would love to examine in more detail. Indeed, I don't have all the knowledge I need to understand all the parts of my model, and I seek guidance along the path.

I plan to use my background in computer science and machine learning to tackle this problem. I plan to put into application my results thanks to my knowledge in robotics. Consciousness covers numerous fields. However, my multidisciplinary studies provided me with the tools to start my investigation.

Looking forward to hearing from you,

Have a lovely day,

Adrien
