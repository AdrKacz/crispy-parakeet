# General

This Git repository stores my ideas on Artificial Intelligence.

I came up with The Loops of the Mind model in 2017 when I studied in Lyon (France). I still have some notes on a notebook from this time.

I write more philosophical considerations inside this folder.

The main work is to describe with precision an abstraction of a living being. However, while I think about it, I always have external thoughts more or less linked to it.

These thoughts don't add any value to the definition of the concepts but can help you understand from where these concepts come.

`drafts.md` contains random ideas not organised yet.
