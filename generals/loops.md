# Basic Knowledge about the Loops

Each system introduces one, and only one, loop.

**Environment system** introduces the most basic loop that goes from you to your environment.

**Primary system** introduces the main loop that goes from Direct memory back to Direct memory.

**Intelligent system** introduces the loop that brings long term memory.

**Reflect system** introduces the loop that mimics the **Environment system's loop.

## About the names of the loops

The Primary system is named primary because it is essential. It is the only system you cannot remove without killing the living being. If you judge it according to its function, you could have called it the Reflex system or the Survival system.

The Intelligent system is the system that brings the ability to remember information. Thus, you could have called it the Memory system. However, remembering information enables you to link pieces of information that are disjoint temporally. This ability to create links bring the fundamental part of intelligence. Thus, this system is named the Intelligent system.

The Reflective system is the system that loops the Decision system on the Direct memory. This loop mimics the loop of the environment. This loop reproduces outside inside the living being. Thus, it is named the Reflection system because it reflects Outside inside.

*As a reminder, the loop of the environment travels first from the Decision system to the System-i's. Then from the System-i's to Outside and from Outside to the Outside interfaces. And eventually back in the Direct memory. The loop of the environment is responsible for the laws that rule all the objects in this environment.*

## The little voice in your head

The reflection loop is free of any laws that apply to outside. This freedom leads lead to introspection and imagination. You feel it.
If you decide to speak without triggering the System-i in charge of the voice, nothing will happen. Without the Reflection system, you will never be aware of this choice. Thanks to the reflection loop, your Direct memory feels your choice and sends this feeling back to the Decision System. Thus, you experience your own decision, and you become aware of your will. You're now able to talk to yourself.
