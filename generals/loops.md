# Loops

Each system introduces one, and only one, loop.

**Environment system** introduces the most basic loop that is the loop that goes from you to your environment.

**Primary system** introduces the main loop that goes from Direct memory back to Direct memory.

**Intelligent system** introduces the loop that bring long term memory.

**Reflect system** introduces the loop that let you imagine **Outside** without having to interact with **Outside**.

*TODO: Make a Naming note to explain why Primary, Intelligent and Reflect are the names of the systems.*
