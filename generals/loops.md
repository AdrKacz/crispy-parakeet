# Loops

Each system introduces one, and only one, loop.

**Environment system** introduces the most basic loop that goes from you to your environment.

**Primary system** introduces the main loop that goes from Direct memory back to Direct memory.

**Intelligent system** introduces the loop that brings long term memory.

**Reflect system** introduces the loop that mimics the **Environment system's loop.

## A bit about name

The Primary system is called primary because it is essential. It is the only system you cannot remove without killing the living being. If you judge it according to its function, you could have called it the Reflex system or the Survival system.

The Intelligent system is the system that brings the ability to remember information. Thus, you could have called it the Memory system. However, the ability to remember information brings the ability to link pieces of information that are disjoint temporally. This ability to create links bring the most essential part of intelligence. This is why it is called the Intelligent system.

The Reflective system is the system that loops the Decision system on the Direct memory. This mimics the loop that goes from the Decision system to the System-i's to Outside to the Outside interfaces back in the Direct memory. This loop reproduce outside inside the living being. Thus, it is called the Reflection system because it reflects Outside inside.

## The little voice in my head

The reflection loop is free of any laws that applies to outside, this is what can lead to introspection and imagination.
If you make the decision the speak without triggering the System-i in charge of voice, nothing will happen. Without the Reflection system, you will never be aware of this choice. With the reflection loop, your choice is felt by the Direct memory and send back to the Decision system where you become aware of your previous will. You're now able to talk to yourself.
