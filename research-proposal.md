### Research proposal - Understanding and Creating Life

## Abstract

I will understand life and intelligent life. And then, I will create life and intelligent life.

What is life? Life is a concept that every human grasp easily without a need for further explanation. You can immediately state that a bird, a dog or a human is alive. However, the more an organism is small the harder it is to make intuitively the distinction between alive and not alive. Nevertheless, even the movement of tiny cells on a microscope makes you think of life.

Life is a so simple concept that properly defining it is tricky. According to the Cambridge dictionary, life is "*the period between birth and death, or the experience or state of being alive*". Then if you look for the definition of alive, you will find "*living, not dead*", for living "*alive now*" and for dead "*not now living*". Apart from the fact that these definitions don't help to understand the concept, I disagree with them on two point. First, the fact that life is finite isn't necessary, it is an observation and consequences of the organic metabolisms that support life. Second, it is necessary to state that something is alive when it is independent from observation. By independent from observation, I don't mean that the living body cannot be helped by other living bodies of not living substances, indeed a lot of living beings live in symbiosis. By independent from observation, I mean that if the living beings exists when you observe it, the living beings will still exists when you'll stop observing it. **Notion of independence to define more accurately**.

**NOTE: More detailed discussion about what is life**.

I will complete my first objective when I will have a generic concept that describe life independently of any implementation of this concept.  The implementation of life on earth is organic life and the implementation of intelligent life on earth involves an organic brain. However, the concept shall not be linked to any physical representation, even if successful representation can help to understand the underlying concept.

I will complete my second objective when I will have an interactive interface that gets along with the previously defined concept. This interactive interface will have to look alive for the great majority. This interactive interface will have to be independent in its environment.

**NOTE: What about reproduction ? The interactive interface should populate the world it is living on if it survives and have enough ressources**.

**NOTE: Distinction between machine learning algorithms and intelligence. The concept of no goal, no purpose, no aim.**

**NOTE: Deep link between life and intelligence (distinction between intelligence and performance describe before)**
