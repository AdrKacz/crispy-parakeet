# Research proposal - The Loops of the Mind

## Ideas of titles

*objective, definition of conscious algorithm, simulation/physics, why, application, where/measure*

1. Implementation of a conscious algorithm using the three Loops of the Mind.

2. Construction of a living mechanism based on the primary Loop of the Mind and its application to implement a conscious algorithm using the three Loops of the Mind.


## Old ideas of titles

* Understanding and Creating Life.

* Understanding life through the primary, the intelligent and the reflection loop of the Mind and Creating three living mechanisms with the primary, the primary and the intelligent, and the primary, the intelligent, and the reflection Loops of the Mind.

* A conscious algorithm using an interconnected cycle of learning.

* Definition of the three Loops of the Mind, construction of a living mechanism based on the primary Loop of the Mind and construction of a living mechanism based on the primary and intelligent Loops of the Mind, and implementation of a conscious algorithm based on the three Loops of the Minds using the learning from the two first construction.

* Definition of the three Loops of the Mind, definition of their minimal implementation and application of their minimal implementation: construction of a simple living mechanism based on the first Loop of the Mind, construction of an intelligent living mechanism based on the two first Loops of the Mind, construction of a conscious living mechanism based on the three Loops of the Mind.

## Research Plan
1. Define the three Loops of the Mind and their implication.

 1. Define algorithms that describe how each loop works.

 2. Define an algorithm that describes how each loop interacts with the others.

 3. What results from experiences in Neurology and Biology supports the Loops of the Mind model?

2. Define the minimum application of the Loops of the Mind model.

  1. Define the minimum set of characteristics that any implementation of the Loops of the Minds.

  2. Given any implementation of the Loops of the Mind model and any environment to host it, what set of characteristics shall have this environment, and how to minimise the size of this set?

    * How easy it is to create a virtual environment with this minimum set of characteristics? Skip tasks marked as optional if it is too complex (more than 2 work of month).

    * The minimal environment for the Primary System, the Intelligent System, and the Reflection System may be different. If it is the case, only implement the set characteristics specifically needed and improve when needed.

3. Implement the Primary System.

  1. (Optional) Implement a virtual environment to host an implementation of the Primary System.

  2. (Optional) Implement a virtual Primary System that evolves in the previously created virtual environment.

  3. Construct or buy a robot that has a minimum set of characteristics as defined before.

  4. Program the robot to implement the Primary System

4. Implementation of the Intelligent System.

  1. (Optional) Improve of the virtual environment to host an implementation of the Intelligent System.

  2. (Optional) Implement a virtual Intelligent System that evolves in the previously created virtual environment.

  3. Construct or buy a robot that has a minimal set of characteristics as defined before. Don't construct or buy a new robot if the minimal set of characteristic didn't change.

  4. Program the robot to implement the Intelligent System

5. Implementation of the Reflection System.

  1. (Optional) Improve of the virtual environment to host an implementation of the Reflection System.

  2. (Optional) Implement a virtual Reflection System that evolves in the previously created virtual environment.

  3. Construct or buy a robot that has a minimum set of characteristics as defined before. Don't construct or buy a new robot if the minimal set of characteristic didn't change.

  4. Program the robot to implement the Reflection System

## A note on reproduction

All the living beings -and thus the conscious being- on earth can reproduce. This ability may be a key to life, and I have to consider it during the research. I will have to create a robot able to reproduce if I find it necessary. The reproduction doesn't have to be complex or to gather multiple robots.

**TODO: Why there is a high chance that I will have to deal with reproduction?**

## Measure of Success

**TODO: Define measures of success**

* The Research Plan is composed of 17 consecutive sub-tasks. The completion of these sub-tasks will define progress.

* The Primary System will succeed if:

  1. It convinces a panel of people that it is a living thing. These people will use as a comparison simple microorganisms like bacteria and fungi.

* The Intelligent System will succeed if:

  1. It convinces a panel of people that it is an intelligent living being. These people will use as a comparison living organism like cats and dogs.

* The Reflection System will succeed if:

  1. It convinces a panel of people that it is conscious of itself. These people will use as a comparison an human being.

*The robot won't communicate if the set of characteristics don't include communication. This is not a sign a failure and shall be taken into account by the panel of people.*

*The living example given above can changed according to the research.*

**TODO: What else that a panel of people?**
