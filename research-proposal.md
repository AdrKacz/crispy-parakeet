# Research proposal

## Ideas for a title

* Understanding and Creating Life.

* Understanding life through the primary, the intelligent and the reflection loop of the Mind and Creating three living mechanisms with the primary, the primary and the intelligent, and the primary, the intelligent, and the reflection Loops of the Mind.

* A conscious algorithm using an interconnected cycle of learning.

* Implementation of a conscious algorithm using the three Loops of the Mind.

* Construction of a living mechanism based on the primary Loop of the Mind and its application to implement a conscious algorithm using the three Loops of the Mind.

* Definition of the three Loops of the Mind, construction of a living mechanism based on the primary Loop of the Mind and construction of a living mechanism based on the primary and intelligent Loops of the Mind, and implementation of a conscious algorithm based on the three Loops of the Minds using the learning from the two first construction.

* **Definition of the three Loops of the Mind, definition of their minimal implementation and application of their minimal implementation: construction of a simple living mechanism based on the first Loop of the Mind, construction of an intelligent living mechanism based on the two first Loops of the Mind, construction of a conscious living mechanism based on the three Loops of the Mind.**


## Research Plan

1. Definition of the three Loops of the Mind and their implication.
 * Definition of algorithms that describe how each loop works.
 * Definition of an algorithm that describe how each loop interacts with the others.
 * What results from experiences in Neurology and Biology supports the Loops of the Mind model?
2. Definition of the minimum application of the Loops of the Mind model
  * What is the easier way to implement the Loops of the Mind model? For examples, the Loops of the Mind model can be implemented inside a virtual environment simulation (that needs to be defined), or inside our physical world using biology, or inside our physical world using robotics.
  * Given an implementation of the Loops of the Mind model, what is the set of characteristic of the environment which host it that minimise the size of the set without impacting the implementation of the model?
3. Implementation of the Primary System
  * (Optional) Implementation of an environment to host the implementation of the Primary System
  * What is the minimum set of characteristic of the implementation of the Primary System? If many, choose the easier to implement.
4. Implementation of the Intelligent System
4. Implementation of the Reflection System
