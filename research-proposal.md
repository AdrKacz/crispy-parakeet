### Research proposal - Understanding and Creating Life

## Objectives

I will understand life and intelligent life. And then, I will create life and intelligent life.

I will complete my first objective when I will have a generic concept that describe life independently of any implementation of this concept.  The implementation of life on earth is organic life and the implementation of intelligent life on earth involves an organic brain. However, the concept shall not be linked to any physical representation, even if successful representation can help to understand the underlying concept.

I will complete my second objective when I will have an interactive interface that gets along with the previously defined concept. This interactive interface will have to look alive for the great majority. This interactive interface will have to be independent in its environment.

## Abstract

What is life? Life is a concept that every human grasp easily without a need for further explanation. You can immediately state that a bird, a dog or a human is alive. However, the more an organism is small the harder it is to make intuitively the distinction between alive and not alive. Nevertheless, even the movement of tiny cells on a microscope makes you think of life.

Life is a so simple concept that is tricky to properly defining it. According to the Cambridge dictionary, life is "*the period between birth and death, or the experience or state of being alive*". Then if you look for the definition of alive, you will find "*living, not dead*", for living "*alive now*" and for dead "*not now living*". Apart from the fact that these definitions don't help to understand the concept, I disagree with them on two point.

First, the fact that life is finite isn't necessary, it is an observation and consequences of the organic metabolisms that support life.

Second, it is necessary to state that something is alive when it is independent from observation. By independent from observation, I don't mean that the living body cannot be helped by other living bodies of not living substances, indeed a lot of living beings live in symbiosis. By independent from observation, I mean that if the living beings exists when you observe it, the living beings will still exists when you'll stop observing it. **Notion of independence to define more accurately**.

**NOTE: More detailed discussion about what is life**.

**NOTE: What about reproduction ? The interactive interface should populate the world it is living on if it survives and have enough ressources**.

**NOTE: Distinction between machine learning algorithms and intelligence. The concept of no goal, no purpose, no aim.**
Why do I want to focus on life first and not on intelligence ? In fact, it mainly depends on your goal. If your goal is to achieve better performance at a given task, you focus on intelligence. However my goal is to understand the concept of life and to create a form of intelligent life.

There is a fundamental distinction between performance and intelligence. What the current state of the art algorithms in Intelligence Artificial achieve is performance. Indeed, these algorithms performs well in a given task. Example of task are image recognition, prediction, or speech.

### GPT-3

I will briefly examine the latest task example: speech. The best example is GPT-3, an amazing algorithm accessible that is able to produce complex answers. Don't get me wrong, the result is awesome, and the algorithm even state that it is intelligent when you ask it. Thus, you have two way of tackling the problem of intelligence with GPT-3.

First, you assume that the algorithm is indeed intelligent. That makes sense, the algorithm is able to process complex question, to extract information, to calculate, to guess result and even to make subtle jokes.

Second, you assume that the algorithm performs extremely well in text prediction. Indeed, GPT-3 was trained on hundreds of billion of text exemples, thus most of the text you will provide for prediction will trigger a pattern already seen during training.

This raise an important dilemma, are you intelligent if you are performant enough ? Or, can you mimic intelligence with good performance ? The answer to the first question is quite hard and I don't have a definitive answer, even though I think the answer is no. The answer to the second question is definitely yes. GPT-3 is good example because it performs well at the complicated task. However, you'll find really performant algorithms that performs simple task in video game that mimic intelligent choices. Shoal of fish for example, the intelligence is not comparable to human intelligence but the simulation performs well enough to mimic fish intelligence.

**What is intelligent and what is not mainly depends on your referential.**

**NOTE: Deep link between life and intelligence (distinction between intelligence and performance describe before)**
