Git repository to store my ideas on Artificial Intelligence while improving my writing skills.

I will first note down my old work on the subject. I started thinking about living being theory in 2017 when I was studying in Lyon (France).

The following diagram represents a general system for the living being. I will describe it more deeply in the following sections.

![whole system](diagrams-output/whole-system.svg)

The structure is composed of 3 systems that add up together.
The **primary system** is the most simple one. It serves elementary purposes.
The **intelligent system** is slightly more complex and provides long term memory.
The **reflective system** is the more advanced. It is responsible for self-awareness.

## *Side notes*

*The purposes of the following work isn't to describe a specific living being. Thus, even by understanding all the concepts explained, you will not be able to create a functional system.*

*In fact, the creation of a functional system is well more complexed and involve to understand each part in relation with the others.*

*The following concepts are abstracts and can be applied to any type of technologies, architectures, and studies.*

*In further work, I will try to put into application these concepts. However it is important to understand that it is not what is done here.*

## Primary system

The primary system can be studied on its own. Indeed, the intelligent system and reflective are not necessary, they are build on this first system to add values.

### Outside

The outside is the raw information perceived by the living being. This information comes from external and internal sensors.

Exemples of outside information are vision, hunger, or touch.

### Direct memory

The direct memory processes the outside information.

How this information is process depends on the internal architecture of the living being.

This mechanism can be influenced by the past experienced of the living being. However, what influenced the direct memory cannot by retrieve by the living being. It is not tangible information.

After being processed, the information is sent to the Decision system and back to the Direct memory.

Thanks to this short loop, the Direct memory can send the same information over and over even if the outside information change. Anyhow, the Direct memory cannot store information in the long term. The loop acts as a buffer memory to give more importance and persistance to potential dangerous and interesting outside events.

It is worth mentioning that all this process is not perceived by the living being.

### Decision system

The Decision system is where choices are made. This is the only system that living beings are aware of.

The System memory and the Decision system are distinct. Indeed, the choice can only be perceived with its consequences. They are distincts so the processed information of the Direct memory is sent back to the Direct memory, and the processed decision of the Decision system is not. If both shared the same output, this wouldn't be possible.

*If by now, you think that you can be aware of your choices even if they don't have consequences, you're totally right. Just think about moving your arm without moving it to convince yourself of it. However this is a much complex behaviour that is not necessary for now. The primary system only describe what cannot be remove in living systems.*


*The Decision system may be understood as consciousness. However, be really cautious when thinking so. First, remember that these concepts describe all living beings and that consciousness may be something specific to your species. Then, do not confuse consciousness and self-consciousness. The former is being aware of the surrounding environment, the latter is being aware of your own existence. You can perfectly make a decision without being aware of yourself. The concept of self-consciousness will come later with the Reflect system.*

### System-i

Once choices are made the information is sent to the System-i's. Those are all different and control different parts of the object linked to the system (commonly called *body*).

The System-i's can be extremely complex and their studies is not the aim here. They are specific to the living being considered.

Examples on these System-i's are voice, movement of different sections of the body, or look.

These System-i's have a direct impact on the outside environment, so their actions can be perceived by the Direct memory. This describe the large loop of life.

In fact, the Primary system only exist within the Environment system. This system is in charge of the link between the Exterior interface you act on and the outside you sense in.

The Environment system can be ignored for now. Its mechanism are quiet complex and understand them don't directly impact our understanding of the concepts explained here.

However, it is important to keep in mind that without the Environment system, nothing exist.
